# Stereo_Vision
 
We will implement and test some simple stereo algorithms.
In each case you will take two images Il and Ir (a left and a right image) and compute the
horizontal disparity (ie., shift) of pixels along each scanline. This is the so-called baseline stereo
case, where the images are taken with a forward-facing camera, and the translation between
cameras is along the horizontal axis. We will calculate the disparity using two ways : Block Matching & Dinamic Programming Approach .
